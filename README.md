# The Movies Dataset API

Rails API built from the MovieLens dataset, containing a database of 45,000 titles. Generates user login and access tokens through RESTful routes.

SQL database generated by a Rake task that translated a .csv file into database entries.

```
  get '/login', to: 'sessions#login'
  post "/login", to: 'sessions#create'
  get '/register', to: 'users#new'
  post 'register', to: 'users#create'
  get "/random", to: 'movies#random'
  get "/longest", to: 'movies#longest'
  get "/rating", to: 'movies#rating'
  get "/popular", to: 'movies#popular'
  get '/letter/:letter', to:'movies#letter'
  get '/year_released/:year', to: 'movies#year_released'
  get '/title/:title', to: 'movies#title'
```
